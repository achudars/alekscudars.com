Cain meticulously navigates through scientific studies, personal stories, and cultural observations to construct a nuanced narrative that challenges societal biases and calls for a reevaluation of how introversion is perceived. Cain begins by defining introversion and extroversion, drawing on the work of psychologists such as Carl Jung. She emphasises that introversion is not synonymous with shyness or social anxiety, but rather a preference for a lower-stimulation environment, with introverts often thriving in quieter, more contemplative settings. The Extrovert Ideal, as she terms it, dominates Western cultures, portraying qualities like sociability, assertiveness, and gregariousness as highly desirable. This ideal is deeply ingrained in various aspects of society, from education to the workplace, influencing how individuals are assessed and rewarded. The author explores the roots of the Extrovert Ideal, delving into the history of self-help culture, the rise of the charismatic leadership model, and the impact of the Industrial Revolution. She argues that these factors have collectively shaped a society that celebrates qualities associated with extroversion, creating a bias that persists in contemporary times. Cain explains that this bias is particularly evident in educational settings, where group activities and collaboration are often prioritised, leaving introverted students at a disadvantage. The book calls for a reevaluation of educational practices to accommodate the diverse learning styles of both introverted and extroverted individuals. Workplaces are another area where the Extrovert Ideal exerts a significant influence. Cain examines how open-plan offices and team-oriented cultures may inadvertently stifle the productivity and creativity of introverted employees. She provides examples of successful introverted leaders who have thrived by embracing their natural tendencies, challenging the conventional notion that leadership is synonymous with extroversion. The author suggests that a more balanced approach that values introverted qualities, such as deep thinking, focused work, and thoughtful decision-making, can contribute to a more effective and harmonious work environment. Throughout the book, Cain weaves in personal anecdotes and case studies, adding a human touch to the exploration of introversion. She shares her own experiences as an introverted individual navigating a world that often expects extroverted behaviour. These personal stories, combined with interviews and examples from various fields, serve to humanise the narrative and make it relatable to readers. In addition to highlighting the challenges faced by introverts, \\"Quiet\\" also celebrates the unique strengths they bring to the table. Cain discusses the power of solitude and its role in fostering creativity and innovation. She explores the concept of the \\"introvert advantage\\" in various fields, from business to the arts, demonstrating that introverts often excel in roles that require deep focus, analytical thinking, and empathetic understanding. The book also addresses the impact of cultural differences on the perception of introversion. While Western cultures tend to favour extroversion, Cain acknowledges that other cultures may place a higher value on introverted qualities. She emphasises the importance of recognising and respecting these cultural variations to create a more inclusive global society that appreciates the diversity of personality traits. \\"Quiet\\" serves as a thought-provoking manifesto advocating for a more inclusive and understanding society. It challenges preconceived notions about introversion and extroversion, encouraging readers to embrace the strengths inherent in both personality types. Through a comprehensive examination of scientific research, cultural influences, and personal stories, Cain provides a compelling argument for reevaluating societal norms and fostering an environment where introverts can thrive alongside their extroverted counterparts. The book ultimately calls for a cultural shift towards appreciating and harnessing the unique qualities that introverted individuals bring to the table, offering a vision of a world where both introversion and extroversion are valued and celebrated."},{"bookTitle":"Talking to Strangers","bookAuthor":"Malcolm Gladwell","yearWhenLastFinishedReading":"2024","summary":"In Malcolm Gladwell\'s \\"Talking to Strangers,\\" the author delves into the complexities of human communication and the challenges we face when trying to understand people we don\'t know. Gladwell explores various cases and social phenomena to illustrate how miscommunication and misinterpretation can lead to tragic consequences. He introduces the concept of \\"defaulting to truth\\", highlighting our natural tendency to believe others and assume honesty in our interactions, even with strangers. Through engaging anecdotes Gladwell demonstrates how our reliance on assumptions can sometimes backfire, leading to devastating misunderstandings. The book also examines the impact of cultural differences, biases, and the limits of our ability to accurately judge others. Gladwell introduces the idea of \\"coupling,\\" where context plays a crucial role in understanding behaviour, and he explores how societal structures and systems contribute to communication breakdowns. Examples of coupling from the book: \\"Sandra Bland\'s Traffic Stop\\": Gladwell discusses the case of Sandra Bland, a young African American woman who was pulled over for a routine traffic stop in Texas in 2015 and later died in police custody. The coupling in this case involves the tense atmosphere of racial tension and police encounters in the United States, which significantly influenced the outcome of the interaction between Bland and the police officer. \\"Cuban Missile Crisis\\": Gladwell explores historical events, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis, to highlight how the coupling of political and international tensions can lead to high-stakes decision-making. Leaders, in such situations, are often constrained by the context and pressures surrounding them. \\"Brock Turner Sexual Assault Case\\": The author delves into the Brock Turner case, where a college student was convicted of sexual assault. The coupling in this instance involves the campus culture, alcohol consumption, and societal attitudes towards sexual assault. The context within which the incident occurred plays a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of the case. \\"Bernie Madoff\'s Ponzi Scheme\\": Gladwell explores the financial world and the case of Bernie Madoff, who orchestrated one of the largest Ponzi schemes in history. The coupling here involves the regulatory environment, the trust placed in financial institutions, and the prevailing economic conditions that contributed to the success of Madoff\'s fraudulent scheme. \\"Eric Garner\'s Death\\": The author revisits the case of Eric Garner, an African American man who died after a police officer placed him in a chokehold during an arrest. The coupling here involves the broader issues of racial tensions, police tactics, and societal attitudes towards law enforcement, all of which contributed to the tragic outcome. Through these examples, Gladwell emphasises how understanding the specific context and environment surrounding an interaction is crucial for making sense of human behavior. Coupling reminds us that actions cannot be isolated from the situations in which they occur, and a nuanced understanding of these contexts is essential for comprehending the complexities of human interactions. Drawing on historical events and psychological research, the author encourages readers to reassess their approach to talking to strangers and to be aware of the potential pitfalls that can arise in human interactions. \\"Talking to Strangers\\" challenges us to question our assumptions, acknowledge the complexities of understanding others, and strive for more effective communication in a world where misjudgments can have profound consequences."},{"bookTitle":"Being Mortal","bookAuthor":"Atul Gawande","yearWhenLastFinishedReading":"2024","summary":""},{"bookTitle":"Antifragile","bookAuthor":"Nassim Nicholas Taleb","dropped":true,"summary":"The book explores the concept of antifragility, a property that goes beyond resilience and robustness, suggesting that certain systems thrive and improve when exposed to volatility, uncertainty, and chaos. Taleb argues that the opposite of fragility is not just resilience but antifragility, which he defines as a quality that gains strength from disorder and unpredictability. The author presents a range of examples from various domains, including finance, biology, and technology, to illustrate the principles of antifragility. Drawing on examples from various fields, Taleb illustrates his concepts with clarity. In finance, Taleb discusses the fragility of large banking institutions and how they often benefit from bailouts, becoming more prone to risk-taking due to the expectation of external support. Contrarily, small businesses, which lack this safety net, are more antifragile as they learn to adapt and innovate to survive in volatile markets. Biologically, Taleb highlights the concept of hormesis, where exposure to small stressors strengthens an organism. He contrasts this with the modern obsession of eliminating all risks, such as overusing antibiotics, which can lead to weakened immune systems. Taleb argues for the importance of allowing the body to develop natural antifragility. In technology, he discusses the benefits of trial and error, citing the example of the venture capitalist model where many start-ups fail, but the few successes more than compensate for the losses. Taleb advocates for a system that allows for experimentation and failure as a means of discovering what works best. Taleb introduces the \\"barbell strategy\\", a risk management approach that combines extreme risk-taking with extreme risk aversion. He uses this strategy to demonstrate how one can create a balanced and antifragile portfolio. By avoiding moderate risks and concentrating on the extremes, individuals or entities can better navigate uncertainty. The author also explores the concept of \\"via negativa,\\" the idea that often it is more effective to focus on removing obstacles than trying to add new elements. Taleb uses the example of the medical field, where avoiding detrimental practices and substances can contribute more to overall health than constantly seeking new interventions. Taleb\'s idea of \\"skin in the game\\" is another crucial concept, emphasising that decision-makers should have a personal stake in the outcomes of their decisions. This principle discourages reckless decision-making and promotes responsibility. The book challenges the prevalent belief in the predictability of the future and criticises overreliance on experts and forecasts. Taleb argues that complex systems are inherently unpredictable, and efforts to control them often lead to unintended consequences. He introduces the concept of the \\"Lindy effect,\\" suggesting that the longer something has survived, the longer its future life expectancy, contrasting it with the illusion of predictability in many modern systems. Overall, \\"Antifragile\\" provides a comprehensive exploration of the concept of antifragility, offering numerous examples and anecdotes from various domains to illustrate its principles. Taleb\'s engaging and thought-provoking writing style encourages readers to reconsider their approach to risk and volatility, advocating for a mindset that embraces uncertainty and builds resilience through adaptation."},{"bookTitle":"Range","bookAuthor":"David Epstein","dropped":true,"summary":"\\"Range\\" by David Epstein explores the idea that generalists, individuals with diverse skills and experiences, often outperform specialists in today\'s complex and unpredictable world. Epstein challenges the prevailing belief that early specialisation is the key to success, arguing that a broader skill set and a range of experiences can lead to greater innovation and adaptability. Drawing on various examples from different fields, Epstein highlights the success stories of individuals who benefited from their diverse backgrounds. For instance, he discusses how the late bloomer Roger Federer\'s varied sports experiences helped him become a tennis legend, contrasting with the early specialisation of Tiger Woods. Another example involves the contrasting approaches of teaching math in the United States and Poland, illustrating the benefits of a more generalist approach to education. Epstein also explores the world of music, comparing the success of the Beatles, who experimented with various styles. Through these examples and more, Epstein challenges the conventional wisdom of hyper-specialisation and encourages readers to embrace a broader range of skills and experiences for personal and professional success in an ever-changing world."},{"bookTitle":"Invisible Women - Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men","bookAuthor":"Caroline Criado Perez","isItWorthReReading":true,"summary":"A fascinating book that explores how the world we live in often overlooks the needs and experiences of half its population — women. It uncovers the ways in which the design of everyday things, policies, and systems can unintentionally discriminate against women, making them invisible in various aspects of life. The book starts by talking about something called the \\"default male.\\" Imagine a world where people assume everyone is like a boy or a man. This happens a lot in the things around us, like the size of car seats or the design of smartphones. The default male thinking leaves out the differences that make girls and women unique.The next chapter explains how women often go unnoticed in data and research. Imagine playing hide-and-seek, and the seekers don\'t even know you\'re playing. This is what happens to women in studies and statistics, making it hard to understand their needs and experiences. Next, buildings, streets, and public spaces are covered. All these are designed with the \\"default male\\" in mind. This can create problems for women who might feel unsafe or find it difficult to navigate the environment. The chapter talks about how making things more inclusive can make the world better for everyone. Then Perez talks about how many things, from medicine to technology, are designed based on data that mainly comes from men. This can lead to products and services that don\'t work as well for women. Furthermore, sometimes, important work that women do, like taking care of the family or doing household chores, isn\'t counted or recognised. She talks about how recognising women\'s work is important for making things fair. Further, Perez shows how women often end up paying more for things like personal care products or clothes. Understanding these inequalities helps us work towards fairness. Health, anotehr topic that Caroline Criado Perez talks about, is crucial for everyone, but this chapter explains how medical research and treatments have historically focused more on men. This often leads to health issues being overlooked in women. Did you know that car safety tests are often done with a male dummy? Perez covers how this can be dangerous for women because their bodies are different. Finally, she discusses how climate change affects women and men differently. recognising these differences helps us find fair solutions. \\"Invisible Women\\" ends by encouraging us to think about how we can make the world more equal. It\'s like playing a game where everyone has the same chances and nobody feels left out. By understanding and fixing the ways women are made invisible, we can create a world that works better for everyone, regardless of gender."},{"bookTitle":"Good Economics for Hard Times","bookAuthor":"Abhijit V. Banerjee, Esther Duflo","isItWorthReReading":true,"summary":"A book that explores big problems in the world and suggests practical solutions using simple language. Imagine you have a big puzzle, and the world is like that puzzle. Abhijit and Esther, the authors, are like puzzle masters. They look at different pieces of the puzzle, like why some people are rich and others are not, or why some countries have a lot of money while others struggle. One of the first puzzles they tackle is about immigration. Imagine people from one place moving to another. Some worry that immigrants take jobs away, but Abhijit and Esther say, \\"Hold on! It\'s not that simple.\\" They show how immigrants can actually create more jobs and help the economy. It\'s like saying, \\"When more friends come to play, everyone can have more fun!\\" Now, let\'s talk about money. The authors ask, \\"Why do some countries have a lot of money, and others don\'t?\\" They explain that it\'s not just about having more stuff. It\'s also about how fair the system is. Imagine you\'re playing a game, and one person keeps changing the rules to win. That\'s not fair, right? Abhijit and Esther talk about making the rules fair for everyone, so the game (or the economy) works better. They also look at jobs and why some people have a hard time finding work. The authors suggest that we can make more spots available by helping everyone get the right skills. Next, they explore the big topic of inequality. Abhijit and Esther talk about ways to make sure everyone gets a piece of the pie, not just a few people. The authors also dive into climate change. They say we need to find ways to use energy that won\'t harm the planet. Health is another piece of the puzzle. Abhijit and Esther talk about how important it is for everyone to be healthy. The authors suggest ways to make sure everyone can be part of the fun. They also touch on education, like the ABCs of life. Abhijit and Esther believe that if we all learn and understand better, we can solve more puzzles together. In the end, the authors want us to think about the world and its puzzles with open minds. They believe that by working together and being fair, we can solve these puzzles and make the world a better place for everyone. So, \\"Good Economics for Hard Times\\" is like a friendly guide to understanding the big puzzles of the world and finding smart solutions that make life better for everyone. It\'s not about making things more complicated; it\'s about making things more fair, like playing a game where everyone has a chance to win."},{"bookTitle":"The Body","bookAuthor":"Bill Bryson","yearWhenLastFinishedReading":"2023","summary":"A captivating exploration of the human body, unraveling its mysteries with wit, humor, and an accessible style that even a non-native English speaker can grasp.

Grit is like having the determination and courage to keep building, even when it gets difficult or you make mistakes. Angela Duckworth tells us that having talent is good, but having grit is even more important. She says it\'s like a magical ingredient that helps us reach our goals. Grit is like having a superpower. It\'s not about being the smartest or the most talented. Instead, it\'s about working really, really hard and not giving up, even when things are tough. Duckworth found that grit is a big reason why some people succeed. Duckworth created something called the \\"Grit Scale.\\" It\'s like a quiz that helps us understand how gritty we are. It asks questions like, \\"Do you finish what you begin?\\" and \\"Do setbacks make you want to give up?\\" Your answers help you see how much grit you have. Duckworth says that effort counts twice. This means that it\'s not just about being smart or talented. It\'s about putting in a lot of effort. Imagine you\'re learning to ride a bike. You might fall down a lot, but if you keep trying and don\'t give up, you\'ll eventually get better. Grit is a mix of passion and perseverance. Passion is like having a big dream or goal. Perseverance is about sticking with it, even when it gets tough. So, if you really love drawing and you practice every day, that\'s passion and perseverance working together. Duckworth also talks about the 10,000-hour rule, which is the idea that it takes about 10,000 hours of practice to become really, really good at something. This could be playing the piano, playing soccer, or anything else. So, if you want to be amasing at something, you need to practice a lot. Throughout the book, Duckworth shares stories about gritty people. These are real-life examples of how grit helped them succeed. For example, she talks about a famous basketball player who wasn\'t always the best, but he practiced a lot and became one of the greatest. Duckworth introduces the concept of a growth mindset. This means believing that you can get better at something if you work hard. If you think you can improve, you\'re more likely to have grit. So, if you\'re not good at math right now, a growth mindset says you can get better with practice. The book also explores how grit is important in school. Duckworth says that even if you\'re not the smartest, if you work hard and stay determined, you can do well. Gritty students keep trying, ask for help when needed, and don\'t give up easily. Duckworth discusses how parents and teachers can help kids develop grit. Encouraging children to pursue their passions, praising their effort instead of just their intelligence, and teaching them that mistakes are a part of learning are some of the ways to nurture grit. Finally, Duckworth suggests something called the \\"Hard Thing Rule.\\" It means each person in the family should pick something hard to do and stick with it. This helps everyone practice grit together. In a nutshell, \\"Grit\\" teaches us that success is not just about being naturally smart or talented. It\'s about working hard, sticking with our goals, and not giving up when things get tough. Grit is like a secret weapon that can help us become superheroes in our own lives. So, if you ever feel like giving up, just remember the power of grit!"},{"bookTitle":"The Personal MBA","bookAuthor":"Josh Kaufman","yearWhenLastFinishedReading":"2021","summary":"A captivating journey into the world of business simplified for anyone, whether you\'re a child or new to the business realm.

Imagine a country where people were punished severely for simply speaking their minds or having different ideas. This is what happened in the Soviet Union, a big country in Europe and Asia. The government, led by a group of powerful people, wanted everyone to think and act the same way. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, is like a brave detective. He decided to find out the truth about what was happening in his country. Instead of solving crimes, he uncovered a huge secret - a network of prisons where innocent people were sent for saying or doing things that the government didn\'t like. These secret prisons were called the Gulag, a place where the government would send regular people - teachers, writers, workers, and even kids - to these faraway, cold, and dark places. People were not sent to the Gulag because they were really bad. It was more like someone didn\'t like what they said or did, and the government would accuse them of made-up crimes. Life in the Gulag was like being stuck in a really sad and scary fairy tale. There was very little food, and people had to work all day, every day. It was so cold, and there were guards everywhere making sure nobody tried to escape. Families were torn apart, and children were sent to special camps where they had to grow up without their parents. Solzhenitsyn wrote down the stories of the people he met in the Gulag. He wanted the whole world to know about the unfairness and cruelty happening in his country. Through his writing, Solzhenitsyn encouraged people to speak up against injustice, even if it was scary. He believed that if more people knew about the Gulag, they would join together to stop the unfairness. It\'s like telling everyone about a bully so that others can help stop the bullying. \\"The Gulag Archipelago\\" is a story about bravery, injustice, and the power of words. It teaches us that even in the darkest times, one person\'s voice can make a difference.

Charles Darwin wondered how these fantastic beings came to be. In this book he explained his brilliant idea – evolution. Darwin starts by talking about how farmers and breeders choose the best animals or plants for certain traits, like a farmer picking the biggest potatoes or a breeder choosing the fastest horses. He suggests that nature does something similar, letting the fittest animals and plants survive and pass on their good traits to their babies. Darwin says there are a lot of animals and plants in the world, but there\'s not enough food and space for everyone. This creates a competition – a struggle for existence. Only the strongest and best-suited survive and have babies. It\'s like a big race, and only the fastest runners get medals. Darwin explains that every living thing is a bit different from its parents. Imagine you have siblings, and each of you has something special about you – maybe one is taller, and another is faster. This variation is essential for the survival of a species. The coolest part of Darwin\'s idea is natural selection. Imagine a world where birds try to find the best food. Some birds might have long beaks, and others short. If the best food is deep inside a tree\'s bark, the birds with long beaks can reach it, survive, and have babies. Over time, more birds with long beaks will be around. This is like nature picking the best tools for the job. Darwin talks more about how species change slowly over time. It\'s like a story that goes on for many chapters, with each generation adding a little twist. Eventually, the story becomes very different from where it started. On the topic of instinct, Darwin goes over some animals that have some incredible abilities. For example, birds migrating thousands of miles without a map. Darwin suggests that these abilities also come from the slow changes over many generations. It\'s like learning from mistakes and getting better over time. He also covers hybridism. Sometimes different species can have babies together, but these hybrid babies are often not as strong or healthy. Darwin uses this to show that species are like big families – they might look different, but they\'re related. He also talks about how it\'s hard to find all the clues from the past. It\'s like trying to read a story when some pages are missing. Even though we might not have all the details, the evidence we do have supports the idea of evolution. Closer to the end of the book Darwin looks at how different animals and plants are related. It\'s like making a family tree for all living things. He also talks about how embryos (baby animals before they are born) of different species look very similar, suggesting a common ancestry."},{"bookTitle":"The Wealth of Nations","bookAuthor":"Adam Smith","dropped":true,"dropReason":"(written in a manner too difficult for me to comprehend)","summary":"Adam Smith talks about something he calls the \\"invisible hand.\\" It\'s like magic! He says that when people work to make money for themselves, it helps everyone. If a baker makes tasty bread and sells it, not only does he make money, but the people in the village get to eat delicious bread. So, by chasing their own interests, people unknowingly help others. It\'s like magic fingers making everything better! Next, Smith thinks that if everyone focuses on what they are good at, instead of trying to do everything, the whole village becomes more efficient. Imagine if everyone in a village tried to be a baker, a farmer, and a blacksmith at the same time. Things would be chaotic! But if they specialise in what they\'re good at, like one person baking, another farming, and another making tools, everything runs smoothly. Supply and Demand - If everyone in the village wants a toy, the toy makers will make a lot, and the price will be lower. But if no one wants toys, the price will be higher because they are rare. That\'s supply and demand. When something is rare and many people want it, the price goes up. But if there\'s a lot of it, the price goes down. Smith also talks about money. Money makes trading easier. Instead of swapping goods directly, like trading a potato for a shoe, people can use money. It\'s like a common language for trading. If you sell your potatoes for money, you can use that money to buy whatever you want. Additionally, Adam Smith believes that governments should not control everything. He thinks governments should protect people and make sure everyone plays fair, but they shouldn\'t tell people how to do everything. It\'s like having a referee in a game. They make sure the game is fair, but they don\'t play it for you. Finally, Smith talks about wealth, and he doesn\'t just mean gold and silver. He says real wealth is having a lot of things that make life better—like good roads, schools, and happy people. It\'s not just about having piles of gold."},{"bookTitle":"Maps of Meaning - The Architecture of Belief","bookAuthor":"Jordan B.

These maps are not like the ones you use to find your way on the street; they are more like mental guides that tell us what\'s important and how we should behave. In our journey, there are dragons – not real ones, but metaphorical ones. These dragons are the challenges and problems we face in life.

Peterson talks about how ancient stories and myths often feature heroes facing dragons, teaching us that challenges are a natural part of life. Next, Peterson explores the ideas of chaos and order. Too much chaos is confusing, but too much order can be boring. Peterson suggests that finding the right balance between chaos and order is essential for a happy and meaningful life. He also covers the Power of Stories - they are more than just entertainment. They are like guides for how we should live. Peterson believes that stories help us make sense of the world, giving us a structure to understand what is right and wrong, good and bad. After that, Peterson dives into the deep waters of truth and meaning. He suggests that what we believe to be true is often linked to what we find meaningful. For example, if you believe being kind is good, it\'s because you find meaning in kindness. Our beliefs and values shape our maps, guiding us through the journey of life. And life is full of mysteries and things we don\'t understand. Peterson talks about the importance of facing the unknown, just like explorers stepping into uncharted territory. Instead of being afraid, he encourages us to be curious and open-minded, ready to learn and grow. Afterwards, he speak about the importance of responsibility. Peterson emphasises that we have the power to shape our lives, and with that power comes responsibility. Making good choices and facing challenges head-on is part of growing up and becoming the hero of our own story. Peterson believes that finding meaning and purpose in our lives is crucial. This doesn\'t mean we all have to do something extraordinary, like become a famous scientist or a superhero. It means finding something that feels important and fulfilling to us personally, whether it\'s helping others, creating art, or being a good friend. Like a caterpillar turning into a butterfly, Peterson talks about the process of becoming a better person. It involves facing challenges, learning from mistakes, and growing wiser. He believes that by striving to be better, we contribute to making the world a better place. Finally, Peterson explores the idea that our individual journeys are connected. Just like pieces of a puzzle, our stories and experiences overlap and interact. Understanding this connection can help us relate to and appreciate others, fostering a sense of community and shared purpose."},{"bookTitle":"Artificial Unintelligence","bookAuthor":"Meredith Broussard","dropped":true,"dropReason":"(did not capture my attention)","summary":"This book explores the world of artificial intelligence (AI) and challenges some common misconceptions. Firstly, Broussard talked about the idea that AI can do everything better than humans. She said, \\"Hold on a second! AI is not a magical solution to all our problems. It\'s not as smart as you think.\\" She wanted people to understand that computers and AI have their limits and can\'t replace the unique things humans can do. She also explained that sometimes people trust AI too much. Imagine if your friend told you a joke, and you laughed, but if a robot told you the same joke, it might not feel right. That\'s because AI doesn\'t really understand things the way humans do. It\'s like a super-fast calculator that can\'t grasp the emotions and meanings behind things. Another important point that Broussard made was about data. She said, \\"AI needs a lot of information to learn, but sometimes the data it learns from is biased.\\" What does biased mean? Well, it\'s like if you only ate your favorite food every day and never tried anything else. Your taste would be a bit biased, right? AI can be like that too, learning from data that might not represent everyone fairly. Broussard wanted people to be aware that just because something uses AI, doesn\'t mean it\'s always the best or fairest choice. She encouraged us to think critically about the technology we use and not just believe it\'s perfect. In her book, she also talked about how some people think technology can solve big problems like poverty or climate change. But she reminded us that real solutions involve more than just fancy gadgets. Humans need to work together and think carefully about the choices they make. She didn\'t want us to be scared of technology, though. Instead, Broussard encouraged us to be curious and ask questions. If a robot does something cool, we should wonder how it works and not just accept it without thinking."},{"bookTitle":"Drift into Failure","bookAuthor":"Sidney Dekker","dropped":true,"dropReason":"(a bit too dry)","summary":"\\"Drift into Failure\\" is like a guidebook for exploring the world of accidents.
